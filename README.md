# HackerRank-CCI - Hackerrank Cracking the Coding Interview Solutions

Hi all! I'm in the process of teaching myself Python.

One of the ways I'm doing so is by working my way through the [cracking the coding interview questions on Hackerrank](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/tutorials/cracking-the-coding-interview).

You can view my Hackerrank profile [here](https://www.hackerrank.com/samgparker)

If anyone has feedback on any of my solutions I'd love to hear it!

Cheers,

Sam
